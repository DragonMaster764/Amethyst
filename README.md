# Amethyst

Our product’s name is “Amethyst”, which is a study organization tool that helps students organize study sessions, review information for their classes, take breaks, keep track of study habits, and keep track of the tasks they have yet to do. The goal for this project is to be able to allow the user to organize themselves academically. This will help keep students organized in their endeavors as they navigate their lives.

## Rationale

The rationale behind this application is that as students, we see the need to have an organized student life, however, this does not come easy for many. Our product aims to keep the students’ important matters in one place, beginning with their academics. We plan to evolve to include life tracking such as event managing, finance tracking, mindfulness and habit tracking, and much more. We acquired inspiration for this product from mainstream software such as Notion, Teams, and Canvas.

## Primary Benefits

The primary benefit of this product for the student is the added balance to the various areas of life, especially at a time where they are continually learning new and big things. The goal for this product is to address the stressful challenge of balancing academics, home life, and personal life.
